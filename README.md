# Analyze A/B Test Results
## Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.
## Project Scope
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
## Statistical Analysis
P-value calculations,
Z-core tests,
Logistic regression,
Multiple linear regression 
## Technologies Used
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy
Jupyter Notebook
## Key Findings
he data analysis results indicate that there is not a significant difference in conversion rates between the new and old pages including from one country to another. Subsequently, we do not reject the null hypothesis.
